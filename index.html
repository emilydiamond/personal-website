      <p>
        👋 Hey there,
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm Emily — I'm currently the Product Director at
        <a href="https://qz.com/">Quartz</a>
        where I lead product management and work to create company alignment through our product strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worn many 🎩🎩🎩 at Quartz: Product Manager of <a href="https://qz.com/">QZ.com</a>
        Product Manager of Advertising and Business Operations, and Director of Planning on the business team.
        Before coming to Quartz, I worked in digital sales planning at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_(magazine)">Lucky Magazine (RIP)</a>
        and <a href="https://www.gq.com/">GQ</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I attended <a href="https://goizueta.emory.edu/">Emory University’s Goizueta Business School</a> and received a dual degree in Marketing and Organization & Management.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was most recently accepted into the 2020 cohort of the <a href="https://journalists.org/programs/womens-leadership-accelerator/2020-class/">ONA Women's Leadership Accelerator.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        My obsessions are ⛷️, celebrity-based crossword 🧩, and eating 🥟.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also trying my hand at coding 👩‍💻... what do you think about this website?
