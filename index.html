      <h1>👋 Hey there</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Emily Diamond — I'm currently the VP, Product at
        <a href="https://morningbrew.com/">Morning Brew</a>
        where I lead product management and work to create company alignment through our product strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worn many 🎩🎩🎩 at Quartz in product management and planning on the advertising side.
        Before coming to Quartz, I worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_(magazine)">Lucky Magazine (RIP 😢)</a>
        and <a href="https://www.gq.com/">GQ</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I attended <a href="https://goizueta.emory.edu/">Emory University’s Goizueta Business School</a> and received a dual degree in Marketing and Organization & Management.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was most recently accepted into the 2020 cohort of the <a href="https://journalists.org/programs/womens-leadership-accelerator/2020-class/">ONA Women's Leadership Accelerator.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        My obsessions are ⛷️, celebrity-based crossword 🧩, and eating 🥟.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also trying my hand at coding 👩‍💻... what do you think about this website?
